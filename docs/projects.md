## Cognition Extension

A Chrome extension that creates a unified interface for AI tools, web search, knowledge management, and personal productivity. Built with a modular architecture where each feature is a self-contained module.

### Core Philosophy

Tools should enhance human capability without creating dependency. The extension integrates multiple AI providers, local models, and web services into a coherent workflow.

### Key Features

- Universal command interface that routes to inference, search, or actions
- Local knowledge graph for connecting ideas and conversations
- Voice-to-text with audio synchronization for better transcription workflows
- Modular design enabling rapid feature development

## AI-First Tooling

Building tools that assume AI collaboration from the ground up, rather than retrofitting AI onto traditional workflows.

### Design Principles

- Start with AI as a thought partner, not an afterthought
- Maintain human agency and decision-making authority
- Focus on augmentation over automation
- Build for iterative collaboration between human and AI

## Open Source Approach

All tools are built in the open, with clear documentation and modular architectures that enable others to build upon the work.
