# Technical Philosophy & Patterns

## Modular Architecture Principles

Software should be built as self-contained modules with clear boundaries. Each module declares its dependencies, exports specific actions, and maintains its own state. This enables independent development, testing, and deployment while ensuring system coherence through defined interfaces.

In practice, this means each feature lives in its own module with a manifest file, clear action definitions, and isolated storage. Modules communicate through pure action/request patterns rather than shared state or direct function calls. This pattern scales from browser extensions to distributed systems.

## Local-First Processing

Processing should happen as close to the user as possible. Models under 80MB run efficiently in browser environments using Transformers.js, enabling real-time inference without network dependencies. Local processing ensures privacy, reduces latency, and maintains functionality during network interruptions.

The threshold matters: embedding models around 80MB work well on consumer hardware, while larger models require server-side processing. Design systems to maximize local capabilities while gracefully handling tasks that require more computational power.

## Extension-Based System Design

Browser extensions provide a powerful architecture pattern with multiple execution contexts. Service workers handle coordination and background tasks, extension pages provide full UI capabilities, and offscreen documents enable heavy computation like machine learning inference. This separation of concerns enables responsive interfaces while maintaining persistent state.

Extensions have access to system APIs unavailable to web applications, making them ideal for AI tools that need hardware integration, persistent storage, and background processing capabilities.

## Chrome OS as Democratic Platform

Chrome OS tablets provide desktop-class extension capabilities at democratized price points. Unlike mobile platforms with limited extension support, Chrome OS runs full desktop Chrome with complete APIs plus platform-specific enhancements for hardware access and system integration.

This hardware democratization matters for AI tools because it puts sophisticated capabilities within reach of broader populations rather than limiting them to expensive desktop systems or restrictive mobile environments.

## Friction Reduction in Knowledge Systems

The best knowledge systems minimize barriers between thought and capture. If users must consciously decide to document something, the system has already failed. Design for passive capture from existing workflows, natural language input, and automatic relationship inference.

Similarly, information retrieval should feel conversational rather than requiring specific search syntax or navigation through complex hierarchies. The distance between question and answer should approach zero.

## Voice-First Interface Design

Voice interfaces should augment thinking rather than replace other interaction methods. Continuous listening with smart interruption detection enables natural conversation flow without requiring push-to-talk or wake words. The system should distinguish between commands requiring immediate action and thoughts that benefit from processing context.

Design for sub-second response times on commands while allowing longer processing for complex reasoning. Voice should feel like an extension of thought, not a separate communication channel.
