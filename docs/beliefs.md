# Core Beliefs

## Individual Capability First

Being AI-native increases an individual's capabilities and allows them to be more impactful in their world. More impactful individuals can better leverage consensus and collaboration tools, leading to more effective group decision-making and problem-solving.

## Technology as Liberation

Technology should increase human freedom and agency, not constrain it. The best tools amplify what humans can already do rather than replacing human judgment and creativity.

## Resilient Communities

Capable people create more resilient communities. When individuals have strong skills, tools, and agency, they can contribute more meaningfully to collective efforts and adapt better to challenges.

## Open Source Philosophy

Building in the open creates better tools and enables others to build upon your work. Transparency and collaboration lead to more robust solutions than closed development.

## Practical Implementation

Focus on shipping working tools that solve real problems today, while building toward larger visions. Small, useful improvements compound into significant capability gains over time.
